          The idea for this lab came from Primer. This video explains the basics of the model.

          Soon more complex models will be added with different rules... so stay tuned!

        h3.title.is-size-3 CSV Export

        p.
          You can download the data generated on the Trends page. It will generate a CSV
          with as many generations as you set in the simulation settings. If you want to
          download data for only one species, set the species filter at the top of the
          Trends page before clicking "Download".

        h3.title.is-size-3 How to Support my Work

        p.
          I release all content online for free, so user support is the only way I can continue
          making things like this. If my work helps you as much as a cup of coffee does,
          consider supporting current and future work any way you can.

        p Besides sharing the apps with others, here are some other ways to help:

        h2.title.is-size-3 Credits
        p.
          The original idea behind this came from
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM" target="_blank">Primer's wonderful video.</a>
        p.
          All of the code was written by yours truly (Jasper), but I couldn't
          have made it look so good without Sarah Berman's artistic direction and
          drawings.
        p.
          And as always, this was made possible by ths support of the
          <a href="https://minuteearth.com" target="_blank">MinuteEarth team</a>.
